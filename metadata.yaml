description: Widow Clemmens is struck down in her parlor while the town's legal professionals
  chat outside the courthouse down the street. An investigation is made and two equally
  plausible suspects are quickly unearthed. But is either guilty? And what role does
  the mysterious Miss Imogene Dare play in this drama? A classic Green mystery notable
  particularly for the extended courtroom scenes in the second half of the book.
